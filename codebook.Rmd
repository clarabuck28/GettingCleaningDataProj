==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

The code analyses the UCI HAR Dataset and provides two tables. The first table has the following variables: 
======================================
- "subject id" - The Subject's ID
- "activity" - the type of activity the subject was engaged in (listed below)
- "type" - Whether the subject was in the training or test group (test vs. train)
-79 variables of time and frequency domain variables that containd "mean" or "std" in the label chosen from an original 561-feature vecotr (listed below).

The second table:
-A tiny data set with the same variables as above, but with only the mean and std calculated for each subject id, activity, and type group. For example, "BodyAcc-mean()-Z_mean" is the mean for all "BodyAcc-mean()-Z" measurements for a given subject and activity, and similarly for the column labeled "BodyAcc-mean()-Z_sd". 


The following are the chosen vector variables:
